<p class="sp2">You see a few of the many attractive styles in which you can put
up pop-corn made on Knott’s Pop-Corn Machines.</p>

<p class="sp1">The top package, a pop-corn brick, is extensively sold from Maine
to New Jersey along the Atlantic coast at beaches and parks in summer.</p>

<p class="sp1">The center picture of bar pop-corn, either ground or whole, is a
New England favorite. The top bar has the paper folded back as it is
held while eating by biting off the bar.</p>

<p class="sp1">The lower left is a package of whole corn fritters or crispettes, while
at the right is shown a crispette on top of some ground corn fritters.</p>

<p class="sp1">The center upper piece is called “two-fers” because it sells two
for a penny. It is a New England piece. The lower center is a penny
cake.</p>

<p class="sp1">These last four pieces are winter goods.</p>

<p class="sp1">The flavors are Molasses (yellow), Chocolate (brown), Vanilla
(white), Checkerberry or Wintergreen (pink).</p>

<p class="sp2">(1) Because now is the time to enter into the manufacture of
pop-corn.</p>

<p>(2) Because every district will soon have its pop-corn factory.</p>

<p>(3) Because your customers will realize that only goods of local
manufacture and high quality, under your trade-mark, are dependably
fresh and wholesome.</p>

<p>(4) Because people are buying more pop-corn than ever before.</p>

<p>(5) Because the demand for pop-corn ground and whole, in squares,
bars, fritters, etc., in New England is as substantial as the demand for
crackers.</p>

<p>(6) Because pop-corn has great possibilities.</p>

<p>(7) Because pop-corn may be put before the public in many ways.</p>

<p>(8) Because if one style is not salable in a certain locality there
are enough that will be, as there are plenty of styles to choose from.</p>

<p>(9) To show that you should trade-mark your goods.</p>

<p class="indentless">(10) To show that the “price toboggan” had better coast empty.</p>

<p class="indentless">(11) To give you guidance, so that no matter what may be your

<b>THE WORLD-WIDE FOOD-CONFECTION</b></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capn">AFTER every man, woman and child gets to know its pleasant taste
and its food value, the world consumption of pop-corn is going to
be something tremendous.</p>

<p>Consider that pop-corn contains the whole of the
grain, and that the grain is thoroughly cooked. It is a
healthful, nourishing food. It is pure. It is a poor
man’s confection and food combined. It is too palatable
for the rich man to ignore. It is considered by
“Uncle Sam” to be such a valuable article that through
the United States Agricultural Department, he has published
two pamphlets for free distribution, Farmers’
Bulletins <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 553, “Pop-corn for the Home,” and No.
554, “Pop-corn for the Market.” By permission of
the department we avail ourselves of some of the information
there given.</p>

<p class="fs70"><b>Unpopped Kernels and Popped Kernels of White Rice Pop-Corn</b></p>
<p class="fs70 indent2">(With Permission of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="clearboth">Out of the more than twenty varieties of pop-corn you are advised
to use White Rice, as that makes the largest popped kernel compared
to the size of the raw kernel, and it is the most common commercial
pop-corn.</p>

<p>As it is the expanding of the moisture in pop-corn by turning into
steam that explodes and cooks the grain, it is necessary to have the right
quantity of moisture, about twelve per cent., and to have that moisture
evenly distributed throughout the kernel, and the kernel otherwise in
fit condition for popping.</p>

<p>Some of the things that spoil the popping quality of corn are:</p>

<p>Seed from which the crop is raised not being acclimated to the locality
in which it is planted.</p>

<p>Other kinds of corn growing near the pop-corn.</p>

<p>Picking before the pop-corn has fully ripened, or picking after the
coming of frost.</p>

<p>Not sufficient ventilation while curing.</p>

<p>Too much drying out; shelled corn dries out faster than corn on
the cob.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7]</span></p>

<p>Shelling the corn too long before popping.</p>

<p>Defects in the kernel itself.</p>

<p>Damage from moths which produce weevils.</p>

<p>Insufficient heat, giving poor popping results.</p>

<p>You see that it is really a delicate proposition to deliver pop-corn
to you that will give you the best results. Therefore, it is not safe for
you to buy pop-corn of any but reliable dealers.</p>

<p>Seventy pounds of ears, air-dried, constitute a bushel.</p>

<p>Fifty-six pounds of shelled pop-corn make a bushel.</p>

<p>One hundred pounds of ears should give eighty pounds of shelled
pop-corn.</p>

<b>PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE</b></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capnY">YOU, when you first tasted a delicious brittle kernel of Pop-corn,
coated thinly with candy, you did not think of the skill attained by
practise, the skill that was necessary in order that your piece of
pop-corn confection might have the right amount of candy on each kernel
of pop-corn and the kernel be of its original full-sized fluffiness.</p>

<p>It is an operation that appeared to you as simple and easy of accomplishment
when you first saw it performed in the hands of an expert.
Then when you tried it? Well, you had “An experience.”</p>

<p>You found that somehow the corn did not act for you the same as
for him.</p>

<p>It did just what you did not expect it to do. It formed into one
big ball of condensed pop-corn. Or it became cold before you got it
really mixed and you could not then mould it into confection; or instead
of the kernels being of their natural large, fluffy nature, you probably
found you had ground them to one-half their natural bulk. In other
words, you found you had something to learn and you were up against
a man’s job. No, you did not give up, but you “cleared for action,”
or in other words you stripped off the coat from your mind as well as
from your back and studied and tried, studied and tried, until you had
the principles, then by practise you acquired speed.</p>

<p>Pop-corn confection is made from the starting of a batch to the
completed confection while the original heat is in that batch. A batch
of candy is solid compared to a batch of pop-corn, so that a batch of
candy may be held to a working temperature by keeping the batch near
a fire, while pop-corn cannot be so handled, it must be worked in small
batches at a speed to reach the finished confection while the original
heat lasts. The working of candy and the heat in it has a tendency
to turn the candy back to sugar&mdash;that is, to grain it. Candy coated pop-corn,
to get the brittle, perfect confection&mdash;that is not grained&mdash;must
be finished confection, while the candy coating is still hot. You see,
then, the great advantage to be realized in using the quickest method.
Knott’s machines are recognized as the best for the speed that produces
quality.</p>

<p>As one item in the process of manufacture, consider the mixing of
the corn and candy.</p>

<p>Hot air rises and cold air descends; you know that, but did you ever
consider that it has a lot to do with your results in making pop-corn?</p>

<p>You know that popped corn is light and fluffy and air passes through
the collection of kernels easily. Think of how hot a kernel must be to
pop and yet you know that it is hardly any time at all before the kernel
is cold. The air surrounding the kernel is heated by the hot kernel:
that air rises and is replaced by cooler air which in turn extracts the
heat from the kernel and so the process continues with speed until the
kernel is the same temperature as the air.</p>

<p>You have often used the pouring of a liquid to more rapidly cool it.
You have lifted spoonful after spoonful of coffee letting it run off the
spoon to cool it. Did it ever occur to you that the pouring of the hot,
boiling syrup onto the pop-corn in a mixing tank is a cooling process?
Because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 12]</span> of hot air ascending and cool air descending, that candy that
you would thus pour onto the pop-corn will cool at a most rapid rate
while you are getting the candy kettle out of the way and your paddle
down into the batch to mix the corn and candy. The doing away with
this pouring of the candy is necessary to the production of the best
goods. You can eliminate it by cooking the candy in a deep kettle and
pouring the pop-corn into that kettle on top of the candy and mixing
the batch in that kettle.</p>

<div class="figcenter w80">
<img src="images/image012.jpg" alt="‡Man stirring contents of a bucket" />
</div>

<p>To coat a kernel of pop-corn with candy is not only for the purpose
of tickling the sense of taste, but by the use of that thin covering of
candy you keep the dampness out of the kernel. To be most effective,
the coating must completely enclose each kernel and yet for the confection
to be of the most delicate and brittle texture you must have
but the least film of a coating of candy covering each kernel and every
kernel the same as every other. To get the best results, you must use
the one best method of manufacture.</p>

<p>If without any time passing, that is, instantaneously, you could
distribute the candy at the instant it reached the point to which you
boil it, the candy then being at its most liquid state, if you could distribute
the candy thus instantly over the kernels, you would have the
ideal thin coating of candy over each kernel of pop-corn. You would
have the most delicious piece of confection you ever set your teeth into.</p>

<p>When mixing by hand, one-half of the time is used in the down
stroke of the paddle, which, of course, is necessary before you can make
the up stroke, or lift the paddle to mix the corn. Yet, of course, that
uses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13]</span> valuable time during which the batch is cooling. A machine so
constructed as to have a rotating paddle always under the corn to lift
the corn up the sides of the kettle and guiding it to fall down the center
of the kettle, such a machine uses no time in return strokes and mixes
the batch almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>At this point in our consideration of the subject, let us see what
we have learned.</p>

<p>It is best to mix the candy and pop-corn in the way that will be the
<b>quickest</b>, <b>the quickest way</b> being to boil the candy in a deep kettle
and mix the batch in that same kettle by the use of a pop-corn mixing
machine.</p>

<div class="figcenter w80">
<img src="images/image013.jpg" alt="‡Man operating a mechanical mixer" />
</div>

<p>Now suppose you use this method for mixing the batch, what size
batch will produce the greatest profit?</p>

<p>You know with pop-corn confection, <b>the lighter it is, the better
it is</b>. Of course the lighter it is the less material to the piece and the
greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 14]</span> the profit. The size of batch you make has an important effect
on the lightness of the confection.</p>

<p>Candy coating of the pop-corn must be soft when the cakes are
pressed in order to have the cake well held together when cooled. You
are cooking above 280 degrees, so your candy must be at a high temperature
when the cakes are pressed to attain the result. At that temperature,
the candy changes quickly from a plastic to a brittle condition.
A batch is too large when the last of it to be moulded is too cool to produce
good light confection.</p>

<p>The batch may be kept from cooling so fast by keeping it enclosed
in a heated tank, but watch the results and don’t expect this to help
much. You must have the tank open to take out the corn to fill the
moulds and while it is open there is bound to be a rush of hot air out
of the tank and a rush of cold air into it on the principle discussed in
the first part of this article. This movement of air takes the heat out
of the batch at a fast rate so that it counteracts the effect of the heating
of the tank.</p>

<p>One good way is to use the hot kettle you mix your batch in to hold
the batch while you scoop the corn out onto the moulds. The quickest
way if you are using a set of moulds is for you to arrange the moulds
on the bench, make a batch just the right size, dump the batch on top
of the moulds and fill them. Then put them through the press. This
has the advantage of getting the corn into the moulds at once while
the candy coating is soft.</p>

<p>When the candy coating of the kernels is too cool when put in the
moulds and pressed, the whole kernels will be broken and you will get
so much corn into each mould that the cake will be solid, hard to bite
into and heavy.</p>

<p>You see it pays better to run small batches. Your cakes will be
light and fluffy and therefore better liked by the consumer. Your materials
will make more goods. A day’s work on this plan will show the
greatest profit.</p>

<p>Consider the utensils used by this method.</p>

<p>Only two kettles, so you have one on the fire while you are mixing
in the other. You have no jacket tank to clean, to grease, with the cost
of the grease, to heat by gas, with the cost of the gas. The use of the
pop-corn mixing machine in this method assures the same sized cakes
being made of less material. The same material produces at least 20
per cent. more finished confection because of the quick and complete
mixing.</p>

<b>ARRANGEMENT OF OUTFIT</b></h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter w100">
<img src="images/image015.png" alt="‡Diagram showing layout of plant" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capnY">YOU will agree with me that unless you have your outfit arranged
right you will be wasting steps, and that one worker will be in the
way of another.</p>

<p>The best way is to have the room arranged so that the raw corn
starts down one side of the room and the finished goods come back on
the other, so that the process of manufacture passes around the room in
a continuous progress toward the shipping point.</p>

<p>This sketch gives you an arrangement to consider. You should
make your Popper and Mill Stand, Stock Tank Stand, Kettle Stirring
Stand and Bench so that you can move them, and thus try various
distances and arrangements to fit the particular line of goods that becomes
your leader.</p>

<p>It is just as bad to have machines too close together as to have them
too far apart, even when arranged in good working order. In the plan
above, room is left for barrels to stand in front of the popper, at the
side of and in front of the mill and room for two at the Kettle Stirring
Stand, one for whole corn and one for ground corn.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16]</span></p>


<div class="section">
<h3 class="centered">ALL POWER EQUIPMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Several conditions of manufacture are changed as the quantity of
production is increased.</p>

<p>You should pop your corn in a separate room from the place in which
the cooking is done. The heat from the poppers&mdash;even with the windows
open in summer&mdash;is very uncomfortable and the escaping gas and burning
dust makes the air very unhealthy. Have your poppers so arranged
that the bad air will rise and escape without disturbing the workers.
Ordinary windows are not enough. Put a ventilator over the poppers.
Place a hood, or canopy over your stoves connected by pipe to outdoors,
so that when any syrup or molasses gets on the stove and creates
a smoke, it will pass off without making the workers uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The arrangement of your factory space as to the location of the
doors, windows, stairs and elevator will effect your placing machinery.</p>

<p>Whether you use individual motor drive, or shaft driven machines,
will effect the arranging of your plant.</p>

<p>What you intend to manufacture and what machines you buy will
also determine how you use your floor space to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Individual motor drive enables you to locate your machines to
better manufacturing advantages.</p>

<p>As your business changes in what you make, as you increase or
change your goods and as you add more machines, you can more easily
move machines to keep the best manufacturing arrangement.</p>

<p>As to cost of operation, it is hard to say under modern conditions
whether one way is cheaper than another. With separate motor to each
machine, you have no overhead shafts and belts to drop oil and dust
and compel you to locate by them. You are not liable to have your
plant idle because the one motor is out of order, or one belt has parted,
you can keep making something if one machine is out of order, for all the
others will be running.</p>


<div class="section">
<h3 class="centered"><a id="Chapter_3.2"></a>POP-CORN POPPER</h3>
</div>

<p>Many manufacturers make a stand for their popper out of three-quarter
inch gas pipe, which is fireproof, clean, simple and cheap. It is
best to have three pipes for the popper to rest on, one across near the
front and two across near the back. These two project to the right
twelve inches for the shelf for mill (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2001_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2001-1">2001-1</a>). By the use of
elbows, tees, flanges and piping you can make a stand to rest on the floor
or hang from the ceiling and bring the popper to the right height for your
barrels. When hung from the ceiling it leaves the floor clear, and in
every way is to be preferred if you make the construction rigid. Determine
the height of the barrel you are to use under your Knott Rotary
Sifter (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X112" title="Go to Stock No. 112">112</a>) and have the top of the stand for popper twelve
and one-half inches higher than that.</p>

<p>Use an iron box or barrel under the popper to catch the unpopped
kernels. In that way you risk no fire should a blazing kernel fall into
it. A blaze in pop-corn is easily smothered by stirring up the corn.</p>

<p>You are urged to use an iron barrel under the Knott Rotary Sifter
(Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X112" title="Go to Stock No. 112">112</a>) to catch the siftings.</p>

<p>Order your popper made ready to attach Knott’s Rotary Sifter,
it costs no more.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">To Operate Popper.</h4>

<p>Remove the pop-corn popper cylinder.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">Directions for Gasoline Fuel.</h4>

<p>See that the valves are closed.</p>

<p>Use only the best gasoline.</p>

<p>Do not fill the tank while the burners are lighted, nor remove the
tank to fill it. Do not let the tank run dry.</p>

<p>If gasoline burners should leak at any time at the hexagon stuffing
box on the valve stem, tighten with pliers. Repeat this operation if
any further trouble occurs from this source. If this doesn’t overcome
the trouble remove the stuffing box and wrap some cotton cord or linen
thread well saturated with common soap around the valve stem. Then
tighten stuffing box.</p>

<p>To prevent smoking up the cylinder you are recommended to use
alcohol (denatured or wood) in generating cups; light and allow to burn
out, then turn on gasoline and light at the perforated cone at top of
burner; turn low.</p>

<p>If you are not used to gasoline burners, get some one who knows
how to show you.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">Directions for Gas Fuel.</h4>

<p>It is essential to have an uninterrupted and sufficient supply of gas.</p>

<p>Do not use a rubber tube to carry gas to the popper if you can connect
the popper directly by pipe. The tubing greatly reduces the pressure.
Run a three-quarter-inch pipe to a small sized Popper; and an
inch pipe to the large sized Poppers. See that the gas comes to this
through no smaller pipe.</p>

<p>Light the burner and turn low.</p>

<p>The distance the pop-corn cylinder is away from the burner is
very important. If your cylinder is too near the burner, your corn will
be really under the heat and not in it. If the cylinder is too far away
from the burner, the corn will be too far away from the hottest part
of your fire. This will show by your corn being roasted instead of popped
and by your popped kernels being small. The distance between cylinder
and the burner should be about 1 inch. This does not mean ¼ inch
or ½ inch, neither does it mean 1¼ inch or 1½ inch. The pressure
of the gas may require that you make a new adjustment of the burner
up or down to get absolutely the best results with the gas you must use.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">To Pop the Pop-Corn.</h4>

<p>Make yourself thoroughly familiar with the motions of operating
the popper with raw corn without fire before trying to pop corn.</p>

<p>A power-driven machine should have the power turned on before
the burner is lighted. This prevents the liability of your forgetting to
keep the cylinder revolving over the fire. If the cylinder is not in motion,
the fire will burn a hole in it or get it out of shape.</p>

<p>Having oiled the shaft with heavy oil, replace the cylinder.</p>

<p>Put in a scoopful of corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18]</span></p>

<div class="captionwide w120">
<p class="sp1 center noindent"><b>This illustrates method of placing corn in cylinder</b></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turn up the fire and revolve the cylinder clockwise, eighteen or
twenty revolutions to the minute.</p>

<p>The popping should begin in one and one-half to two and one-half
minutes.</p>

<p>After the popper has been running a little while and becomes thoroughly
warmed up, popping may begin in one and one-half minutes.</p>

<p>When the popping is about two-thirds completed, if you are using
gasoline fuel, turn down the inside burner only. When gas is used
turn the valve off about half-way.</p>

<p>In case pop-corn catches fire in the cylinder, put in a scoop of raw
corn, which will extinguish the blaze.</p>

<p>After a little practice you will know from the discharging corn just
what moment to turn the cylinder slowly backward and stop to dump
the unpopped kernels. On the power machines you must draw the
bolt on the crank before you can turn it backwards.</p>

<p>Put in another scoopful of corn.</p>

<p>Turn up the burner, and if you are using gasoline, first the outside
and then the inside one, so that the lighting will be from the outside.</p>

<p>Proceed as before.</p>


<div class="section">
<h3 class="centered">PEANUT CYLINDER</h3>
</div>

<p>This machine may be used as a peanut roaster by using a special
peanut cylinder in place of the pop-corn cylinder. These cylinders are
carried in stock at the factory and will fit your popper.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">To Roast Peanuts.</h4>

<p>Open the slide, insert the funnel and put in peanuts until the cylinder
is three-quarters full. Then close the slide; remove the pop-corn
cylinder; light the burners; put the peanut cylinder in the machine,
then revolve the cylinder at the same speed as the pop-corn cylinder,
about eighteen to twenty revolutions per minute.</p>

<p>Test the peanuts by running a tryer in the hole in the cylinder.</p>

<p>It will require twenty to thirty minutes to roast.</p>

<p>Empty the cylinder by drawing it part way out, turning it hole
downward and swaying it back and forth.</p>

<h3 class="centered">GRINDING POP-CORN</h3>
</div>

<p>Grinding pop-corn is not the same as crushing raw grain. Pop-corn
should be torn apart when it is ground and not mashed, as it is the
fluffy, light texture you desire to maintain.</p>

<p>Knott’s Mills (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2001_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2001">2001</a> and Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X109" title="Go to Stock No. 109">109</a>) accomplish the
same work in different ways, but the former is of disc construction and
the latter of the cylinder type. The former is slower but uses much
less power.</p>

<p>In case of Mill, Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2001-1 (see <a href="#Page_24" title="Go to Page 24">page 24</a>), which is power-driven,
the construction is such that it will make no great difference
whether the pop-corn is put in before or after the mill is started.</p>

<p>Adjustment is made by the thumb screw in the hub of the pulley.
Turning in causes the mill to grind finer.</p>

<p>In case the pop-corn does not feed in the hopper a stick run down
in the Hopper (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2020" title="Go to Stock No. 2020">2020-1</a>) or a common knife stuck in between
the machine and the Hopper will cause the machine to start grinding
again.</p>

<p>Hopper (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2020" title="Go to Stock No. 2020">2020</a>) for this mill holds a bushel of pop-corn.</p>

<p>Knott’s Grinder, Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X109" title="Go to Stock No. 109">109</a> is the machine for efficient work.
Every last bit of pop-corn put in the hopper will be ground without
attention.</p>

<p>Never open the slide to let the pop-corn to the grinder until after
the power is on. If the power is put on after the pop-corn is let into the
machine it will choke, in which case you will have to shut the slide
and turn the machine over by hand to clear it.</p>

<p>Adjustment is made by the thumb screw on the side of the machine.
Screwing it in causes finer grinding. By tightening up the lock nut on
the adjusting screw you lock the adjustment.</p>

<p>One tank is for the purpose of holding molasses and the other you

<p>These stoves are made so that if you want the other fuel burner

<p>Read the directions under Pop-corn Popper for generating the gasoline
burners and follow them in using gasoline stoves.</p>

<p>The gas stove burner you can regulate for air supply and for gas.
This burner is a special one which we recommend because the heat is
drawn to the center in a revolving shape like a whirlwind, concentrating
the heat on the bottom of the kettle where you want it.</p>

<p>The Electric Blower Stove gives a much hotter fire and the cost of
running it is small.</p>

<h3 class="closeup">Knott’s Pop-Corn Kettle</h3>

<p>Copper kettle, 19 inches in diameter by 17 inches deep, with single
grip handles.</p>

<p>Special sizes. If you want them tell us.</p>

<p>Made light for lifting, but especially strong and durable to stand
the stirring of pop-corn.</p>

<p>Weight about 14½ pounds.</p>

<p>Knott’s kettle is the right one to use for all around factory pop-corn
work. It is the style used in the pop-corn factories of New England,
because they find this method requires the least labor and because
it uses less candy to cover the corn. It enables you to cook the candy
higher than other methods and thus increases the keeping quality of
the pop-corn confection.</p>

<p>You boil your syrup in this kettle. Because you are boiling for
each batch less than a gallon of stock, it is not convenient when working
fast to use a thermometer. Pop-corn makers use one of four tests,
according to their experience in the business. 1.&mdash;The so-called “water
test,” half a teaspoonful of syrup dropped in cold water. 2.&mdash;The test
by the color of the syrup. 3.&mdash;The test by how it leaves the paddle when
scooped up on it. It will string off or come off in lumps, so-called “ragging
off the paddle.” 4.&mdash;A test by the steam or smoke which rises
from the kettle.</p>

<p>You are advised to get a confectioner’s thermometer and make
the other tests at the same time you use the thermometer, doing it with
syrup over a slow fire and in that way learn how the syrup you finally
determine to use will act at the temperature you require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27]</span></p>

<p>Practical experience is the one way to learn. Do not expect to
make a good batch the first time nor the third time, but you need have
no discouragement if you have not reached perfect results on your
twelfth batch.</p>

<p>In beginning, you are likely to cook candy too high to be easily
worked into shape.</p>

<p>Efficient pop-corn making is not to be learned very easily; it comes
with practice.</p>

<p>When you are running on one kind of pop-corn as a specialty so
that you want to get out one batch after another as fast as possible, it
is well to use two fires and two kettles. One kettle with syrup may be
warming up while you are boiling the other.</p>

<p>You will find it well to use a cover on your kettle, part of the time,
one of Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2005_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2005-1">2005-1</a>, or one that you can make yourself out of thin
wood. The object is to let the condensing steam run down and thus
clean the sides of the kettle.</p>

<p>Copper or wood covers are best, an iron cover rusts out quickly.</p>

<ul class="stocklist">
<li><a id="X2005_1"></a>Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2005-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copper Steaming Cover for kettle</li>
<li>Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2005-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nickeled Copper Steaming Cover for kettle</li>
</ul>

<p>These covers will last you a long time because they are of heavy
material and handle riveted with copper rivets.</p>


<div class="section">
<h3 class="centered">STIRRING STAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Take the kettle off of the fire and set it in your stirring stand. The
stirring stand may be made of a band of iron supported on three or four
angle iron legs, or you can cut off a barrel to fit your height and use that
as a stirring stand. Put some stones or sand in the bottom to steady it.</p>

<p>Stirring pop-corn is not as easy as it looks. A beginner’s courage
is tested sometimes by giving him a batch to stir in which there is no
grease. He makes no start at all. Again he may be tried on a wintergreen-flavored
batch with an extra dose of flavor. His eyes run so with
water that usually he does not finish the batch.</p>

<p>Try this plan: Put the corn in the kettle, then with your left hand
on the middle of the paddle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2006_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2006-1">2006-1</a>) and your right hand over
the end, make strokes down against the side of the kettle and up through
the middle of the batch, at the same time walking around the kettle.
Efficient stirring will come with practice.</p>

<p>Stir the pop-corn quickly, but have the batch light, not soggy.</p>


<div class="section">
<h3 class="centered">MACHINE MIXING OF POP-CORN AND CANDY</h3>
</div>

<p>The use of the Knott Pop-Corn Mixing Machine has been well
considered and yet the mechanical mixing of pop-corn cannot be emphasized
too much.</p>

<p>Many failures in the pop-corn confection business are due to poor
mixing. Soggy confection, “hot spot,” that is spots in the confection
where there is much more candy than anywhere else. Uneven appearance
and texture to the confection, due to slow mixing.</p>

<p>See that you make the best, and only by using Knott’s Pop-Corn
Mixing Machine can the best be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 28]</span></p>

<p>You must realize that a dough mixer is not a cake mixer, is not an
egg beater, is not a concrete mixer, is not a pop-corn mixer.</p>

<p>You know the materials are not alike and the result wanted in each
case is different.</p>

<p>You see why you should use a machine specially developed for
pop-corn, to distribute the hot syrup quickly and evenly over the pop-corn
and give a light fluffy mixture.</p>

<p>Knott’s Pop-Corn Mixing Machine is made specially for Pop-corn,
to give the result you want.</p>

<p>Use this method for quality and economy. Mix your Pop-corn in
the hot kettle, in which you have just boiled your syrup, and use Knott’s
Pop-corn Mixing Machine.</p>

<p>You mix all kinds of pop-corn on this machine better than it can
be done any other way.</p>

<p>Whole pop-corn is mixed without breaking the kernels.</p>

<p>Goods are mixed up light, fluffy, thoroughly, evenly.</p>

<p>You distribute the syrup so quickly over the pop-corn that you can
cook it higher.</p>

<p>The goods eat better.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">Economy.</h4>

<p>You do away with hand mixing entirely.</p>

<p>Make more goods with less labor.</p>

<p>Not so many containers.</p>

<p>The cook makes no difference.</p>

<p>You get more cakes from the same batch; that is, you save in any
case more than fourteen per cent. on your bills for material.</p>

<p>Stirs a bushel of pop-corn without throwing any out of the kettle.</p>

<p>Mixes different kinds of batches without any change of adjustment
of either paddles or speed.</p>

<p>Nothing to wear the kettles.</p>

<p>So quickly is the syrup distributed that it takes less syrup to cover
the pop-corn.</p>

<p>In regard to swinging the kettle to dump the batch. Pop-corn
kettle (<a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">Stock No. 2004-2</a>) is not heavy, weighing but fourteen and one-half
pounds, and with the pop-corn batch in it, it weighs but a few pounds
more. The kettle is swung away from the face thus: take hold of the
two handles, swing the kettle underneath from left to right, upward,
still keeping the left hand away from yourself and the right hand near
you, until the kettle is more than half-way up. Then hold the two
handles the same distance away from you. That rotates the kettle
upon its center axis while you are swinging up the rest of the way to
the top position, at which you stop to dump the batch. You will notice
by this motion that the kettle bottom comes nowhere near your face.
During the swinging you are moving the kettle so that when you stop
the batch falls out right upon the bench or machine just where you want it.</p>

<p>The first two or three times you try this feat, all the pop-corn may
not go where you want it, but after that you will have no difficulty.</p>

<h3 class="centered"><a id="X2007_1"></a>PANS. STOCK <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2007-1</h3>
</div>

<p>You see, in making square corn cakes, bricks or bars, there are
three operations: panning, pressing and cutting; each quickly performed,
but the tools used must be right in detail in their dimensions or the
greatest difficulty will be experienced, even to the point that you will
not be able to make the goods at all.</p>

<p>The kettle of pop-corn, all stirred, yet hot, is dumped into the
pans arranged together on the bench. You pan the corn evenly and
quickly by hand. Now turn each pan of corn upside down on the bench.
Take off the pan and slip it under the pop-corn. The pop-corn is then
in the pan bottom-side up so as to present a more even surface to the
pressing plate in the press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31]</span></p>

<p>Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2007_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2007-1">2007-1</a> pans are the right size for you to pan the corn,
by moving your two hands toward you across the pan, with a side motion
of your wrists, leaving an even pan of corn and taking to the next pan
whatever surplus comes over in your hands. This is certainly the quickest
pan to use.</p>

<p>These pans are made from heavy
galvanized sheet steel with heavy
wired rim. The clearance of the
sides is right. This is the pan that
will stand considerable usage.</p>

<p>This hand press is rugged, simple and efficient.</p>

<p>You bolt it to a bench with the arch twenty inches from the front
edge of the bench. Slip in the plate for pan work, and fasten it in place
by means of cap screw. Slide a pan under and screw down plate into
pan. This locates the pan so that you can bring against it the three
guides, two sides and back; tighten them in place so that you can slide
the pan in between them and bring the press down without danger of
the plate coming down on the edge of pan.</p>

<p>Do not press your pop-corn too solid; it does not eat as well and
takes more stock per box.</p>

<p>Put the three sets of round cake plungers on the press cross-bar,
locating them by putting the mould plate under the press and fastening
them by tightening the cap screws. Adjust and clamp the guides each
side and at the back of mould plate, so that when you fill it you can slide
it in and bring the plungers down without their striking on the edges.</p>

<p>You may put a block under each end of the press cross-bar against
the inside of the arch as a stop to regulate the thickness of your cakes.</p>

<p>Three plunger castings are made with small cap screws to fasten
them on top of the bench.</p>

<p>Use them to push the cakes out of the mould plate, by pushing
this plate down over them.</p>

<p>In the making of assorted flavor bricks of pop-corn, you run five
batches and fill five pans out of each batch.</p>

<p>First batch, white, vanilla flavor. Second batch, molasses. Third
batch, chocolate. Fourth batch, molasses. Fifth batch, pink with wintergreen
flavor.</p>

<p>You use five transfer racks and put them in a row on the bench. Turn
a pressed pan of corn right from the press upside down on the table to
get out the sheet of corn; take the sheet of corn and put it in the transfer
rack by putting the back end down first, bend sheet in the middle,
put the front end down and then press down the middle. You have
five sheets, or pans from a batch; put one in each transfer rack. Do the
same with each of the five batches. Sheets being made each one inch
thick, the transfer racks will be just filled.</p>

<p>Place a full transfer rack of pop-corn in place on the cutting rack
and push the pop-corn down into the cutting rack. Remove the transfer
rack. Now run the full cutting rack of pop-corn under the knife in the
cutting machine.</p>

<p>The push-out stand should be placed conveniently on the bench,
so that you put the cutting rack of cut pop-corn on this push-out stand.
As the rack goes down over the stand, the bottom board goes up with
the corn on it, so it may be lifted off and the corn slid off onto the packing
table.</p>

<p class="sp2">In the manufacture of penny-pop-corn, it is good to cut them one
sheet at a time, then when the goods have become cold pack them. It
is necessary to cut them while warm. When the sheets are piled up and
cut together as in the Brick and Bar cutting machine, Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X111" title="Go to Stock No. 111">111</a>,
they stick together and in the case of the assorted brick, that is just what
is wanted. When cutting penny goods, the cakes are wanted separated.</p>

<p>This machine cuts one sheet at a time, but at many times the speed
of hand cutting. The sheet is put in the rack and passed through one
way, cutting the corn in strips, then the rack is turned and passed through
the second part of the machine, which completes the cutting by severing
the strips into blocks.</p>

<p>You arrange this machine on your bench in the position as above
in the picture. It is best to drive it from a motor on the bench by a
chain, but it may be driven from a shaft overhead by belt.</p>

into cakes faster than you can get the batches to it. No longer need
you blister your hands filling corn into moulds and make your cakes
too solid, or have the batch get cold before all are moulded. As the name
says, this machine is a “self filling” machine. You simply place the
freshly mixed corn in the hopper on the feed rolls and the machine lays
the finished cakes on the conveyor.</p>

corn fritters, but it works well on ground pop-corn.</p>

It is made up special for cakes of square and oblong shape. It is
also used in putting out strips of corn marked to be broken into penny
pieces. In fact new applications of this machine are being found constantly.
Even a ball of pop-corn is one of the products this machine
can be made to produce.</p>

<p>With this automatic means of moulding corn, you can now make at
a profit small and thin cakes of corn that could not be made by hand.</p>

<p>Individual Motor Drive is the most flexible and economical method
of driving pop-corn machines. No shafting, no belts, no dirt or grease.</p>

<p>We have found by experience that this type of motor can be relied
on at all times. Cheaper motors may be bought, but they are not cheap
to run. Here are the motors you should have:</p>

<br />
<b>RAW MATERIALS</b></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capnY">MEASURE your raw materials accurately for every batch. Have
your color, flavor, salt, butter, etc., put up in bottles or wax paper,
the measured quantity for each batch, and thus maintain uniform
quality. Buy these of a Confectioners’ Supply House.</p>

<h3 class="noshow">Pop-Corn</h3><p class="sp05"><b>Pop-Corn.</b>&mdash;Use only the best, for in the end that is cheapest at
any cost. That does not mean that you must pay high prices, nor that
high prices assure the best quality. You must judge the quality of the
goods by testing them.</p>

<p>Write the E. R. Knott Machine Company for a list of Pop-corn
dealers.</p>

<p>Use the best of White Rice Pop-Corn. Secure samples from the
dealers and test them in your popper for quality in size of popped kernels,
for quantity popped from a scoopful, for length of time it takes to
pop, for the amount of waste or unpopped kernels.</p>

<p>Pop-corn of one year’s crop should not be used before the next
June and pop-corn from that crop should be used up by the following
June. The corn maintains its popping quality best by being kept on
the cob, so that corn ought not to be shelled long before it is popped.</p>

<p>Pop the day’s supply of corn the same day you intend to use it.</p>

<p>Use the best. Keep your barrels covered and clean.</p>

<h3 class="noshow">Corn Syrup</h3><p class="sp05"><b>Corn Syrup</b> is used not only because it is cheaper than sugar but
principally to prevent the candy from graining. The amount of dextrine
in it will have a direct effect upon the graining results. Corn
syrup varies in the amount of dextrine it contains, ranging from zero
per cent. to forty per cent. Twenty-five per cent. at least is required
in corn syrup in order to use it with sugar and stop graining, that is, to
prevent the syrup from turning back to sugar. Too great a proportion
of corn syrup will cause the candy to be tough.</p>

<p>For various kinds of goods and for the same goods in different
seasons and climates you will vary the proportion of corn syrup.</p>

<p>You must experiment with the materials that you have available,
but you may take this as a basis to start from: seventy-five per cent.
of sugar and twenty-five per cent. or less of corn syrup. This will grain
and not be sticky or tough, and you may use water on your tools to
prevent sticking.</p>

<p>Seventy-five per cent. of sugar and twenty-five per cent. or more of
corn syrup will not grain.</p>

<p>Wet your hand before picking up corn syrup so that it will not stick.
This method works well in cold weather, but in warm weather use a
dipper or let the corn syrup run out of the barrel.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Butter and Substitutes.</h3>

<p>Nothing will spoil the quality of your goods so quickly as a low
quality of butter. Exercise great care to see that the butter is fresh,
pure and sweet. Put the butter into your candy in the kettle with your
syrup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 44]</span></p>

<p>There are substitutes for butter that may be used in some goods
with good results, but be careful, for the keeping quality of the goods
is important, as well as the taste when freshly made. Many a business
has been a failure because quality was neglected. Quality means freshness,
appearance, keeping value, wholesomeness, and the power to stand
heat or cold.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Salt.</h3>

<p>Some brands of salt create chemical action and the result is poor
goods. Do not use any low-grade salt.</p>

<p>Use salt every batch. Most candy and pop-corn makers do not use
enough salt.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Molasses.</h3>

<p>Different grades of molasses will give different flavors to the product.
“New Orleans” is good. After once adopting a grade be sure to hold
to it and not disturb your trade by radically changing the flavor of
your goods. Molasses is graded by its sugar content.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Water.</h3>

<p>This does not receive the attention which it should.</p>

<p>You know that the chemical analysis of water from two local situations,
not to mention water from distant points, often varies widely.
Therefore, water certainly has considerable to do with the quality of
your candy.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers do not use water in their recipes because they
say it all has to be boiled out and that the chemical action is not good.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Cream of Tartar.</h3>

<p>Cream of tartar is used to prevent the sugar returning to sugar or
graining, as it is called. A cream of tartar killed batch is short and dry.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Soda.</h3>

<p>Soda used with molasses makes the candy a lighter color by generating
gas, which expands it.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Colors and Flavors.</h3>

<p>The pure food law requirements must be followed and you can
secure from your supply dealer the right articles.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">Color.</h4>

<p>You may add your coloring to the batch in the kettle on the fire.
Put up in measured amounts beforehand just what you want to use in
your batches, then all batches will be alike.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">Flavor.</h4>

<p>Use the best. By putting it into small bottles, each containing
enough for a batch, your goods will all be alike.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Raisins.</h3>

<p>There are several styles of raisins to be had; seeded and seedless,
and of course, several brands of each. Don’t consider using raisins with
seeds in them, as these will not please your trade. Try the different
kinds to be found in your local market.</p>

<p>Not enough raisins is better than too many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45]</span></p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Nuts.</h3>

<p>Peanuts are to be preferred to other kinds of nuts for mixing with
pop-corn. Use the small, well-cleaned, roasted entire nuts with whole
or medium ground pop-corn. The small quantity of nuts will make
the separate pieces stand out and one poor nut spoils the appearance
of the cake and box. A bad nut will make a customer refuse your brand.</p>

<p>Peanuts broken up or ground to the size of half a pea is suggested
as one good way to use them.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Cocoanut.</h3>

<p>Care must be exercised in the purchase of cocoanut to see that you
are getting quality. Cocoanut may be had either grated, shredded,
thread and sliced.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Chocolate.</h3>

<p>Use the bitter cake-chocolate and cut it up into small pieces.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust"><a id="Chapter_4.1"></a>Paper.</h3>

<p>Crispette wrapping paper is eleven inches long by twelve inches
wide. The best paper we know of for this purpose is a forty pound
manila wax paper, seventy sheets to the pound. Have it printed at
the mill before it is waxed, otherwise the printing will fade, or rub off.
A good method is to use a large type label to put inside to show through
the plain waxed paper.</p>

<p>Bricks are wrapped in wax paper, size 9 × 12 inches wide, and then a
blue paper band with your name upon it is put around to hold the wax
paper in place. The wax paper weighs one hundred and twenty-eight
sheets to the pound.</p>

<p>Bars are wrapped in wax paper measuring 7 × 16 inches. One hundred
and ninety sheets to the pound.</p>

<p>Layer paper, to be put into the boxes between unwrapped pop-corn,
may be had. Grade forty pound manila comes in sheets 24 × 36 inches,
or cut to the size you want. Twelve sheets 24 × 36 inches weigh one pound.
Write E. R. Knott Machine Co. for a list of Wax Paper Makers.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Boxes.</h3>

<p>The size of your box must be determined by what you want to put
in it.</p>

<p>Penny goods are packed 50, 72, 100, 144, etc., in a box; five-cent
package goods 20, 24, 50, 100 in a box.</p>

<p>Buy your boxes of some local supply.</p>

<p>If that is not possible, buy your boxes flat from the nearest convenient
maker and use a Corner Box Stitcher to put them together.</p>

<p>Boxes take up less storage space. You make them up as you need
them. Boxes are stronger. Other pop-corn manufacturers find this the
best way, so you should investigate the method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46]</span></p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Tin Cans.</h3>

<p>Cans, with covers to keep out moisture or the cover put on with a
piece of wax paper under it, to exclude moisture, may be used to good
advantage by a retailer to protect his stock or by the manufacturer in
order to insure the keeping qualities of his corn in the retailer’s hands.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Cases.</h3>

<p>Cases for shipping boxes of pop-corn may be made of corrugated
paper or fiber board. Use that which is the cheaper in your own locality.</p>

<p>Crates made of wood may be the best method for your shipping.</p>

<p>Put 10, 12, 20 or 24 boxes in a case or crate.</p>

<b>RECIPES AND FORMULAS</b></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capnY">POP-CORN must form the base of the confection; it is not a material
that can be added to a confection with any improving result.</p>

<p>The public when it buys a nut bar, wants a nut bar, and when it
buys a pop-corn bar, wants a pop-corn bar, and not a bar made up half
and half.</p>

<p>In the use of cocoanut, raisins, or nuts in pop-corn, let the quantity
of these be very small in proportion to the pop-corn.</p>

<p>Sell your partly popped and unpopped kernels for chicken or pig
feed at one cent a pound. Do not harm your confectionery business
by trying to use them in that.</p>

<p>You can grind that product in your mill (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2001_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2001">2001</a>) as fine
as coffee. Sell it as a breakfast food to be served with cream and sugar
or to be cooked and served like oatmeal. It will take more power to
grind it than it takes to grind pop-corn, so do not expect your popper
motor to do it.</p>

<p>An excellent breakfast dish is made by putting a little milk upon
a molasses fine pop-corn cake. Try it.</p>

<p>Grind sifted pop-corn to make your fine corn cakes, not the siftings.</p>

<p>If you desire to put up an extra fine grade of buttered pop-corn, or
pop-corn brittle, you may use a wire screen size one and one-third to
the inch and separate the largest popped kernels for these high-grade
goods.</p>

<p>You will find that a small amount of cocoanut will add to the quality
of pop-corn when made up in vanilla or molasses syrup in the form of
brittle or cakes.</p>

<p>Ground, shredded, thread or flaked cocoanut may be used to increase
variety and please various trade. In fact, all three styles of
cocoanut added to one style of pop-corn is a good thing.</p>

<p>The use of cocoanut in winter and in summer and its use in pop-corn
in different climates with the risk of its becoming rancid are to be considered.</p>

<p>Fresh cocoanut will make a better tasting piece of confection, for
it gives a flavor all its own. You must cut it up, grate it and use it in
your confection on the same day in order to insure the quality of your
goods. If the cocoanut is enclosed in a coating of the candy it will keep
as well as the pop-corn.</p>

<p>Dried cocoanut will not become rancid, and will add to the quality
of your confection. You need not be afraid of its becoming rancid when
you do not get it completely incased with candy.</p>

<p>As to whether the cocoanut is ground, shredded or flaked, makes
no difference as far as its use is concerned, but it gives a different flavor
and appearance to the confection.</p>

<p>Butter should be cooked into the candy to get the best results.</p>

<p>Use a heaping tablespoonful of cream of tartar to ten pounds of
sugar to stop graining when you use no corn syrup. Cook it in the candy.</p>

<p>A little Konut cooked in the candy for coating whole pop-corn makes
it stir more easily. Use half as much as the recipe calls for butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48]</span></p>


<h3 class="leftjust"><a id="Chapter_5.1"></a>Boiling or Cooking Syrup.</h3>

<p>This is the most important operation. If you do it wrong nothing
done afterwards can correct it.</p>

<p>Boiling is to take out the water from your syrup.</p>

<p>The proportions of ingredients will affect the amount of boiling
required.</p>

<p>The higher the altitude at which the boiling is done the lower is
the degree required to boil it, and the degree will vary to which the
candy must be cooked to have it harden in cold water.</p>

<p>You must cook your syrup higher in summer than in winter to attain
the same keeping qualities.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is advisable, especially in warm weather, to cook your
syrup high and then add molasses, which will set it back. Then boil
to your test.</p>

<p>Cooking your candy high may prevent you having time before it
hardens to get it well spread over the corn. At the same time you must
carry the various operations through as fast as possible so you may be
able to use high cooked candy.</p>

<p>Any time you let a batch cook too high you can set it back by adding
a little syrup or water.</p>

<p>The degree of cooking alone does not regulate the keeping. The
proportion of the materials also has to do with the keeping qualities.</p>

<p>If you are using too small a proportion of corn syrup to the sugar
the resulting candy will turn back to sugar, that is, it will grain just the
same, no matter to what degree you cook it, unless you use cream of
tartar.</p>

<p>In some kinds of ground pop-corn penny goods, it is desirable to
let the candy grain in order to prevent stickiness. This is attained by
the use of a smaller proportion of corn syrup to sugar and by not letting
the goods cool off entirely before boxing. Boxing while warm induces
graining.</p>

<p>Candied pop-corn that it is intended should grain a little, may be
kept from sticking to the machines and tools by wiping them with a
wet rag or sponge. You can easily tell whether to use water or butter
when the other will not prevent sticking.</p>

<p>Grease is used in the candy to give the required elasticity and make
it less moisture attracting.</p>

<p>The coating of pop-corn with candy is done to keep the pop-corn
from absorbing moisture. Consequently the candy must be as moisture
proof as possible. And each kernel of pop-corn should be entirely enclosed
in a candy casing.</p>

<p>A recipe containing corn syrup and sugar may be boiled to a higher
degree than a recipe with molasses in it. Also a clear sugar batch may
be boiled to a higher degree than any other. It takes an expert to boil
sugar to 345 degrees over an open fire and not burn it. If you use a
lot of molasses you cannot boil high enough to prevent sticking and
spoiling. Use light molasses, New Orleans molasses. It costs more,
but gives quality.</p>

<p>Cooking to a high degree dries out the candy so that it attracts
moisture more unless other ingredients, such as grease, are put in to
counteract it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49]</span></p>
<p>Days when the air is heavy with moisture and the weather warm,
it is better not to make candy or make only what you cannot get along
without, for the reason that it becomes sticky so quickly that you cannot
wrap it before it is in condition to stick to the paper.</p>

<p>You see that you cannot be told just what proportions of materials,
cooked to a certain test, will result in a candy that will keep in your
territory. You must find that out for yourself. This book merely points
out the way.</p>

<h3 class="centered">RECIPES</h3>
</div>

<p>When measuring pop-corn for these recipes a peck is a heaping
peck measureful.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">1. Buttered Pop-Corn.</h4>

<p>Put one pound of best creamery butter into the pop-corn kettle
(<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) and set it on the stove. Melt and boil the butter. Considerable
steam will rise from it. When that steam has cleared away,
which will be in a very short time, the butter is boiled enough. Take
the kettle off the fire, set it on top of a barrel, and stir in a handful of
salt. Dump two pecks of whole pop-corn into the kettle. Mix it by
a motion of stirring and lifting the paddle (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2006_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2006-1">2006-1</a>) up through it.
After thoroughly mixing, bag from the kettle or put the corn in a water
jacketed buttered corn tank (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2019_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2019-1">2019-1</a>) from which it is sold hot.
After a batch or two you can make the proportions to suit your trade.
This article should be made fresh and sold retail at five cents for a ½
pound bag holding a pint. Use Knott’s Pop-Corn Mixing Machine and
put in four pecks of pop-corn to one pound of butter.</p>

<p>Never sell buttered corn made the day before. It will drive trade
away.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">2. Sugared Pop-Corn.</h4>

<p>This is made in three flavors and put up in seven different styles.
It is sold extensively in Philadelphia and that section of the country.
It is generally made in three colors and flavors. Chocolate, white with
vanilla flavor, and pink with wintergreen flavor. Other flavors may be
made with colors to correspond, such as orange, lemon and sassafras.
When put into ¼-pound glacine bags to sell for five cents, or when
put into gelatine-covered boxes, so the corn will be protected but still
visible, you can have it in single flavors or any desired combinations.</p>

<p>Here is the way to make it:</p>

<p>Put in your kettle (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) on the stove (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X113" title="Go to Stock No. 113">113</a>) 25
pounds sugar (12½ quarts), 2½ pounds corn syrup (1¼ quarts), 3 quarts
water. Bring to a boil and pour into syrup stock tank (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2013_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2013-1">2013-1</a>).
Put in kettle on fire 2 quarts syrup and ½ ounce butter. Boil until
it hardens in cold water; set kettle on Mixing Machine; add a little vanilla
for flavor. Dump in one peck of whole pop-corn; stir until it separates;
add your chocolate or color over the fire and add the flavor after the
kettle is set on the stirring stand.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">3. Brittle.</h4>

<p>This may be made in different flavors and colors: chocolate, vanilla,
wintergreen, molasses, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 50]</span>Use soda only in molasses brittle. The most common is molasses
brittle with cocoanut.</p>

<p>Place your kettle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) on the stove with 48 pounds
sugar (24 quarts), 18 pounds corn syrup (9 quarts), 2 gallons water
(8 quarts), 1 quart molasses. Bring to a boil and pour into syrup stock
tank (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2013_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2013-1">2013-1</a>).</p>

<p>Put in kettle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) 3 quarts syrup and ¾ pound
butter and heaping teaspoonful salt. Boil 320 degrees. Before entirely
cooked put in half a pound of long thread cocoanut.</p>

<p>Set the kettle on the Mixing Machine and stir in a heaping teaspoonful
of baking soda. Dump in two pecks of whole pop-corn. Stir well.
Dump on table while hot and spread out in open thin style to cool.</p>

<p>Put up in ½-pound, 1-pound bags, 5-pound, 10-pound boxes, or in
barrels.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">4. Crispettes or Molasses Round Whole Pop-Corn Cakes or Fritters.</h4>

<p>Place in your kettle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) 48 pounds sugar (24 quarts),
16 pounds corn syrup (8 quarts), 2 handfuls of salt (¼ quart), 2 gallons
of water (8 quarts), 2 quarts of molasses. Bring to a boil and pour into
syrup stock tank (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2013_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2013-1">2013-1</a>).</p>

<p>Put in your kettle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) 1 quart of syrup, Konut
half size of a hen’s egg (Konut is a butter substitute) and butter size of
a large hen’s egg. Boil to 300 degrees. Set kettle on Mixing Machine.
Dump in two pecks of whole pop-corn. Stir thoroughly.</p>

<p>Scoop out onto crispette mould and proceed as instructed,
<a href="#Page_31" title="Go to Page 31">page 31</a>.</p>

<h5>Recipe B.</h5>

<p>Put into the kettle 18 pounds corn syrup (9 quarts), 1 gallon molasses
(4 quarts), 1 gallon water (4 quarts), 4 pounds butter, 4 pounds
parasub (a butter substitute), 10 pounds “C” (a grade of brown) sugar.
Bring to a boil. Melt in 40 pounds white sugar. Pour this in syrup
stock tank. Letting this syrup stand over night seems to season it
so it uses better.</p>

<p>Put in the kettle 1 quart of syrup. Boil to 300 degrees. Drop
in a tablespoonful of salt just as you take the kettle off the fire. Put
kettle on Mixing Machine. Dump in two pecks of whole pop-corn. Stir
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Scoop out onto crispette moulds and proceed as instructed,
<a href="#Page_31" title="Go to Page 31">page 31</a>.</p>

<p>The maker of this recipe claims that cooking the salt in the batch
makes the candy sticky.</p>

<h5>Recipe C. <span class="nobold">(With soda.)</span></h5>

<p>Put in kettle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) 75 pounds (37½ quarts) sugar,
25 pounds (12½ quarts) corn syrup. Bring to a boil and pour into syrup
stock tank (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2013_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2013-1">2013-1</a>.)</p>

<p>Take ¾ quarts of stock in kettle on fire. Add ¼ quart molasses,
¼ pound Konut, parasub or other good butter substitute. Put in ⅛
pound butter and a tablespoonful of salt. Boil to 285 degrees. Set
kettle on Mixing Machine and put in pinch of soda. Dump in one peck
of sifted whole pop-corn. Stir thoroughly and quickly. Scoop out
to fill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 51]</span> crispette moulds or dump batch on three pans and proceed as
instructed on <a href="#Page_30" title="Go to Page 30">page 30</a>.</p>

<h5>Recipe D. <span class="nobold">(With cream of tartar.)</span></h5>

<p>Put in kettle (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2004_2" title="Go to Stock No. 2004-2">2004-2</a>) 60 pounds sugar (30 quarts), 2 gallons
water (8 quarts). Bring to a boil and pour into syrup tank (Stock
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2013_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2013-1">2013-1</a>).</p>

<p>Put in kettle on fire 1 quart stock, ⅛ quart molasses, ¼ pound
butter, 1 even teaspoonful cream of tartar. Boil until hard in cold
water. Set kettle on Mixing Machine. Dump in two pecks whole pop-corn.
Stir thoroughly and quickly; dump while hot on pans or fill
moulds.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">5. Whole Pop-Corn.</h4>

<p>This may be made up in round sticks, bars, bricks, blocks, round
cakes and balls, any shape. Many flavors and colors may be used. The
white pop-corn yields well to using colors to represent various flavors.</p>

<p>Chocolate is its own color. Use pink color with wintergreen flavor,
vanilla with the natural white color of the pop-corn, molasses is its own
color, orange color with the orange flavor, etc. These five colors, each
in eight shapes, give forty varieties of pop-corn packages.</p>

<p>Use 60 pounds sugar (30 quarts), 40 pounds corn syrup (20 quarts),
2 gallons water (8 quarts). Bring to a boil and pour into syrup stock
tank (Stock <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> <a href="#X2013_1" title="Go to Stock No. 2013-1">2013-1</a>). Put in your kettle 1½ quarts of this stock.
The color, or chocolate, you may put in the batch on the fire, the flavor
(wintergreen, orange, vanilla, etc.) you must add to the batch when you
take the kettle off the fire, otherwise the flavor will boil away. Add
chocolate just before you take kettle off the fire. Put in a teaspoonful
of salt and a piece of butter size of half an egg. Boil to 286 degrees.
Take kettle off fire and set on Mixing Machine; add flavor. Dump in
one peck of sifted whole pop-corn and stir thoroughly. Fill crispette
moulds or dump on pans and proceed as instructed, <a href="#Page_30" title="Go to Page 30">page 30</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that a handful of fresh ground flaked or shredded cocoanut
adds a variety to the goods; also raisins and peanuts. Add these
at the time you set the kettle off the fire onto the stirring stand. These
increase the number of styles under this recipe over two hundred and
forty.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">6. Fine Pop-Corn.</h4>

<p>Follow the foregoing recipe for making fine or medium ground pop-corn
cakes.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">7. Pop-Corn Sandwiches.</h4>

<p>Make pop-corn in sheets three-eighths or one-half inches thick.
Between two sheets put peanut butter, whole peanuts, raisins, etc.
The particular likes of your neighborhood may be catered to by the
filling you put into these sandwiches. You can cut them into various
sizes, even as small as a caramel if you wish.</p>

<h4 class="leftjust">8. Pop-Corn Bricks.</h4>

<p>Make five batches: first, molasses; second, vanilla; third, chocolate;
fourth, wintergreen; fifth, molasses. Fine pop-corn. Each batch
is panned, pressed one inch thick and cut up in rack; make as
many piles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 52]</span> as you run pans; place the vanilla on top of the molasses.
The cutting rack has a beveled edge so that it will easily slip over the
previous sheet to register the cut cakes one on top of the other. When
the five sheets are piled you can easily separate the bricks for wrapping.
Use Knott’s Brick and Bar Cutting Machine, it does the best work.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Oh! What to Do When Materials Cannot Be Had.</h3>

<p>Sugar in the shape of the good old white granulated sugar is not in
sight sometimes (as in 1919, or in the year 1917 all through the
Eastern States).</p>

<p>Consider brown sugar. Remember that brown sugar is not to be
used in white goods. It can be used in place of combined white sugar
and molasses; weight of brown sugar for weight of white sugar, plus
molasses, with nearly same results. There are several grades of brown
sugar and the price increases as the grade improves. If you use brown
sugar, where formerly you used white, reduce by from 10 to 20 per cent.
the quantity of corn syrup to a batch.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">No Sugar of Any Kind to Be Had?</h3>

<p>Then get some grape or corn sugar. You will have to work out
new formulas, yes; but that is oftentimes better than going out of
business.</p>

<p>Corn syrup? Yes, even get along without it. Before corn syrup was
on the market cream of tartar was used to cut the grain of sugar.</p>

<p>It needs more accurate handling of the batch and requires working
with cleaner kettles than is required with corn syrup. Try using an
invert sugar, or corn sugar. Water will cut the grain in sugar if enough
is used.</p>

<p>Without cane sugar and without corn syrup, how is pop-corn to be
made? Do not forget there is honey, corn, or grape sugar, maple sugar,
molasses and sugar substitutes on the market. Molasses alone cooked
as high as it will go without burning will make a good winter corn cake.
Honey is a very fine flavor and of high sugar content.</p>

<p>Pop-corn cakes can be made, even without sugar or corn syrup and
be mighty nice in flavor and wholesome. When you do not get sugar,
others do not have it and if you can deliver goods, you make the price
to cover any increase in cost of materials.</p>

<br />
<b>DISTRIBUTION</b></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capn">BE afraid to have accounts receivable as well as accounts payable.
Well-made pop-corn keeps about as well as crackers. You can, therefore,
follow the cracker manufacturers’ distribution methods somewhat,
the taking of orders and delivery by wagon to retail stores, the
packing in tin cans, the wrapping in wax paper sealed packages, etc.</p>

<p>You must depend on the consumer to keep your factory in operation,
so always let the consumer take up most of your mind.</p>

<p>The methods used in getting your goods to the consumer will be
chosen according to where the consumers you want to serve are located.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Mail Order.</h3>

<p>You have the mail order method which will enable you to reach a
large market. You get the retail price for your goods, you can do your
business where rents are low, you can get the goods to the customer fresh.
However, you must secure a way of getting orders that will not take all
the profit. The package to insure delivery of the pop-corn in perfect,
wholesome condition must not be unreasonable as to its cost.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Retail.</h3>

<p>You may sell at retail over a store counter. Your sales in this case
depend on your location and your advertising to draw trade to the
store. Best locations in cities require the payment of big rent, which
pop-corn will not warrant. A good location in a center of population
at a fair rent, then advertising to your prospective customers with samples
is the best, but be sure your advertising is consistent with your prospects.
Now, in addition to this, send out pedlers on a commission basis.
Have your goods on sale at the moving-picture theatre entrances, at
the band concerts, at the ball games, at every picnic. In fact, every
time a crowd collects have your goods sold. When displaying goods
on counter, or when using cans or boxes to store the goods, be sure the
oldest goods are at the top of the can, or at the top of the pile on the
counter so that those will be sold first. Use tins to keep pop-corn in;
it keeps better.</p>

<h3 class="leftjust">Wholesale.</h3>

<p>Remember the consumer must get your goods under your trade-mark
when they are fit, to make him want more.</p>

<p>Besides making your goods so they will keep as long as possible,
and packing them so as to exclude dampness, you should endeavor to
know about the goods in the dealers’ hands so that the consumer may
buy nothing stale.</p>

<p>Seldom is it advisable to sell pop-corn through jobbers because they
merely provide another shelf for the goods to grow old on. Therefore,
sell to the retailer and follow him up every few days.</p>

<p>If a retailer does not sell a particular kind of pop-corn you have
sold him, take it back and give him another to try. If that does not
go, try another. His trade will like some kind of pop-corn. When you
have found the right kind, you have a steady customer adding to your
sales.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 54]</span> Possibly his trade wants penny pieces, perhaps package goods;
five-cent, ten-cent, pound. Instead of one for a cent cake, maybe there
is sale for the same goods in smaller, two for a cent cakes. Possibly
raisins or nuts or cocoanut and pop-corn may be preferred. An examination
of his class of customers will help decide.</p>

<p>Include in the box of goods a small, neat price sign. If package
goods, include one glass-covered package for display. All these selling
helps work to your benefit.</p>

<p>Follow the experience of cracker, breakfast food and other manufacturers.
Advertise through window displays in prominent locations,
and give away samples. Furnish show-cases, shelves, racks, counter
displays, etc. Get your goods up, on top, in front, where the public,
the consumers, must see. Get samples into their mouths so they may
get a taste.</p>

<p>If you must sell through jobbers, number your packages. Keep
a record of the numbers on your shipping orders. Plainly print on your
package something like this: “To insure the public receiving our goods
in wholesome condition this number 2746 is on our shipping record.
If you receive this package in unfit condition, send it to us and you get
right back two fresh from our packing table. Only by satisfying the
public do we expect to have our business prosper.”</p>

<p>By shipping in tin cans, or waxed paper sealed packages, you increase
the keeping life of your goods.

<h2><a id="Chapter_8"></a>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr><br />
<br />
<b>COSTS</b></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-capnY">YOUR costs are made up of three classes of items: Labor of making; material
they are made of; the container they are sold in. The other
expenses of the doing of business are the “overhead,” so called.</p>

<p>To arrive at the cost of goods by the box and to know what profit
you ought to expect, should be your first endeavor.</p>

<p>Selling is ninety per cent. of any business. To make sales enough
to keep your plant going to its full capacity and be able to refuse undesirable
business should be your constant aim. Then and only then are
you making the greatest profit possible from your investment.</p>

<p>Your labor cost of making any piece of goods is easily figured. If
a man, a boy and a girl turn out one hundred boxes in a day, the sum of
the wages you pay them divided by one hundred gives the labor cost
per box.</p>

<p>The material cost per box is easily found by finding how much
raw corn it takes to give you pop-corn for a batch. Figure its cost.
The candy and other materials you mix with a batch cost you a certain
amount. Divide the sum of these by the number of boxes you get from
a batch and add the cost of paper, string and box, then you have the
material cost.</p>

<p>“Overhead” contains a large number of items and is the class of
costs that is the worst to figure. It contains rent, heat, light, power,
shipping, freight, express, cartage, advertising, printing, postage, stationery,
insurance, taxes, repairs, depreciation, and all non-productive
labor, such as sweeping out shop, bookkeeping, managing, etc. You
must take these, figure the total for a week or a month, divide by the
number of working days in the week or month, then divide by one
hundred, the number of boxes made in a day. Then you have the “overhead”
cost per box.</p>

<p>Add together the “overhead,” material and labor cost per box and
you have the total cost per box if you are running your shop to capacity
on that piece. Remember, in figuring your selling price and profit that
making several kinds in a day increases the cost per box because of the
time and labor lost in getting ready, and remember that some dull days
will come when your “overhead” continues on just the same, but you
have less boxes of goods to carry it.</p>

<p>Before you turn a wheel you should estimate your “overhead”
expenses, and then watch them close to see that you do not increase
them.</p>

<p>The manufacturing retailer receives one hundred cents of the consumers’
dollar. The wholesale manufacturer must sell to the retailer
at a price at which the retailer can make a profit.</p>

<p>A wholesaler gets from sixty to seventy-five cents from the retailer
for goods sold by the retailer at one dollar.</p>

<p>Some goods are sold for less but only at a reduced quality, or the
loss of part of the legitimate profit.</p>

<p>When you put in new machinery that cuts cost you keep the saving
in your own business. Talk quality, maintain the selling price and put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57]</span>
part of your saving into selling endeavor to increase your business and
the other part into a bank account. Cutting prices pays no one a profit.</p>

<p>You ask how much profit there is in pop-corn?</p>

<p>You know of fortunes made in pop-corn; some from buttered pop-corn;
some from sugared pop-corn. Some from pop-corn cakes that sell
for a cent, some from pop-corn packages that sell for five cents. In one
case the goods were sold all retail, in another at wholesale. In one case
a local business, in another nation-wide business.</p>

<p>What is profit? Net profit is the return over and above all expenses.
Gross profit is the return over the cost of simply making the goods.</p>

<p>What is cost? Prime cost, which is the material plus the actual
labor of making, or it may be the total cost with all the expenses of doing
business added.</p>

<p>You might make a gross profit of two hundred per cent. of your
prime cost, which might be sixty per cent. of your sales and then you
might make twenty per cent. net profit on your sales, or sixty per cent.
net profit on your prime cost. But it is possible to come out with no
net profit in the end. In other words you must understand that the
part of the cost that will determine your profit is what is called the
“overhead,” meaning what is termed the operating expenses, something
that is up to you and you alone.</p>

<p>To prevent errors you should figure your profit percentage on
your selling price, because the sales figures are always handy to get at.</p>

<p>Thus if you find the gross cost of a box of pop-corn to be twenty-five
cents and you sell it for fifty cents, your twenty-five cents profit is
fifty per cent, of your sales.</p>

<p>A small net profit and turning your money over often will amount
up big in the run of a year.</p>

<p>If you make a net profit of twenty per cent. and turn your money
over twelve times a year you are making two hundred and forty per
cent. upon your working capital.</p>

<p class="sp1">Your costs will perhaps show some variation from these figures,
for it is not to be expected that costs will be the same everywhere.</p>

<p>The costs here given are figured from the formulas in this book
using the machinery herein described. They are not the lowest at which
the goods can be produced, and of course, you see that they contain no
“Overhead” and therefore are gross and not net profit.</p>

<p>No two men running business under identical conditions will have
the same prime cost, gross cost, or gross profit, but they may come out

<p>Every machine has grease cups, oil cups, or oil holes, and the directions
with each machine call attention to the particular places, if any,
that require particular attention.</p>

<p class="sp1">Machine makers find ninety per cent. of customers’ troubles are directly
traceable to lack of attention of cleaning and oiling. Why is it
you expect a machine to oil itself and keep the dirt out of its way? Dry
bearings wear fast and once you let them get real dry and start to cut,
then oil will not bring them back, and sometimes does not stop the
cutting. You know dry bearings require more power to drive them.</p>

Again you oil them without cleaning them.</p>

time and money.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
